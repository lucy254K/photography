      <p>Photography is a way of feeling, touching, and of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever. 
      It remembers the little things, long after you have forgotten everything.</p>
      <p class="username">Love for photography is good. There are seven elements of photography:
        lines, textures, shapes, forms, patterns, colours, and spaces. Each provides a different dimension to a picture when used together.
